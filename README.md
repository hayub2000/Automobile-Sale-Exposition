to manage this data. There is a lot of data to work with, and no means or methods to
organize this data, which is where this database comes in to provide convenience to all
parties involved in an orderly manner.


Introduction:
This system is about an Automobile Exposition held within City. Our project displays
available used Vehicles to the Customers, which are provided by Dealers, sell through Staff
and managed by the manager.

Future work
Despite the numerous amounts of data & structure optimization we performed, we
couldâ€™ve improved the database further in various places. Several features such as, making
an official website where Customers & Dealers from all around the country can buy and
sell vehicles on a much larger platform.

Note:
In order to run this project, you'll need to XAMP to run phpMyAdmin and Apache for a server to host the site on.
You must import the database into phpMyAdmin with the following details:

1. Name the database 'project' without the inverted commas.
2. Use the appropriate username and password for your system (default is often 'root' and '', without the inverted commas)
